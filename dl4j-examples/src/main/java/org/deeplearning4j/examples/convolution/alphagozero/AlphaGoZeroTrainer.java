/**
 * Train AlphaGo Zero model on dummy data. To run a full AGZ system with DL4J, check out
 *
 * https://github.com/maxpumperla/ScalphaGoZero
 *
 * for a complete example. The input to the network has a number of "planes" the size of the
 * board, i.e. in most cases 19x19. One such plane could be "the number of liberties each
 * black stone on the board has". In the AGZ paper a total of 11 planes are used, while in
 * the previous AlphaGo version there have been 48 (resp. 49).
 *
 * The output of the policy head of the network produces move probabilities and emits one
 * probability for each move on the board, including passing (i.e. 19x19 + 1 = 362 in total).
 * The value head produces winning probabilities for the current position.
