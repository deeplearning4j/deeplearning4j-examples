 * Define and load an AlphaGo Zero dual ResNet architecture

 * The dual residual architecture is the strongest
 * of the architectures tested by DeepMind for AlphaGo

 * followed by a number (40 for the strongest, 20 as
 * baseline) of residual blocks. The network is topped
 * off by two "heads", one to predict policies and one
 * for value functions.
