/**
 * @author susaneraly on 3/1/17.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * 1. The forward pass on VGG16 is time consuming. Refer to "FeaturizedPreSave" and "FitFromFeaturized" for how to use presaved datasets
 * 2. RAM at the very least 16G, set JVM mx heap space accordingly
 *
 * We use the transfer learning API to construct a new model based of org.deeplearning4j.transferlearning.vgg16.
 * We keep block5_pool and below frozen
 *      and modify/add dense layers to form
 *          block5_pool -> flatten -> fc1 -> fc2 -> fc3 -> newpredictions (5 classes)
 *       from
 *          block5_pool -> flatten -> fc1 -> fc2 -> predictions (1000 classes)
 *
 * Note that we could presave the output out block5_pool like we do in FeaturizedPreSave + FitFromFeaturized
 * Refer to those two classes for more detail
