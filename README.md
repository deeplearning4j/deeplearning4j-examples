Repository of Deeplearning4J neural net examples:

- MLP Neural Nets
- Convolutional Neural Nets
- Recurrent Neural Nets
- TSNE
- Word2Vec & GloVe
- Anomaly Detection

## Build and Run

Use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) to build the examples. 

```
mvn clean package
```

Run the `runexamples.sh` script to run the examples (requires [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)). It will list the examples and prompt you for the one to run. Pass the `--all` argument to run all of them. (Other options are shown with `-h`).

```
./runexamples.sh [-h | --help]
```
