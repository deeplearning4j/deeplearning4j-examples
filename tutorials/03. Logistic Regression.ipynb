    "With deep learning, we can compose a deep neural network to suit the input data and its features. The goal is to train the network on the data to make predictions, and those predictions are tied to the outcomes that you care about; i.e. is this transaction fraudulent or not, or which object is contained in the photo? There are different techniques to configure a neural network, and all of them build a relational hierarchy between the inputs and outputs.\n",

    "Regression is a process that helps show the relations between the independant variables (inputs) and the dependant variables (outputs). Logistic regression is one in which the dependant variable is categorical rather than continuous - meaning that it can predict only a limited number of classes or categories, like a switch you flip on or off. For example, it can predict that an image contains a cat or a dog, or it can classify input in ten buckets with the integers 0 through 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple logisitic regression calculates 'x*w + b = y'. Where 'x' is an isntance of input data, 'w' is the weight or coefficient that transforms that input, 'b' is the bias and 'y' is the output, or prediction about the data. The biological terms show how this artificial neuron loosely maps to a neuron in the human brain. The most important point is how data flows through and is transformed by this structure.\n",
